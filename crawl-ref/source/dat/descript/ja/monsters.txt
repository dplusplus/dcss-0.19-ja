death. His head is that of a boar with bulging eyes and tusks split in two, his
snout flares and oozes as he snorts and squeals at the sight of you, his mouth
is a toothless rift which drools pools of blood and vomits forth disgusting
remains. His neck is stretched and lops forward, its skin sagging downward. His
immense gut writhes and distorts as the larvae within await their repugnant
release. His legs are unrecognisable masses of flesh, covered in protrusions
and throbbing boils. Your mind reels at the sight of this hideous form and your
senses begin to shut down in an attempt to preserve your sanity as you choke on
the oppressive stench.
